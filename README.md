## Purpose  
This is my personal porfolio after all of UTA MERN Bootcamp. Over the course of the UTA MERN Bootcamp we have done projects and honed our skills to become will stack web developers. Now that the course has ended, this is a React portfolio comprising of all the projects and assignments I am most proud of.

## Features 
Clicking the tabs to go from page to page of my portfolio.

## Technologies-Used  
This project was made possible with React, React-Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML5+CSS and React-Particles-Js.  

## Installation  
There is no need to install this application for use, because it is hosted at the links provided above. However, for code inspection or etc, if you have SSH Keys linked, you can simple use your terminal and clone the repo down, otherwise, the typical zip.

## Usage  
There are tabs at the top of the page that you can click to go to the tabs of the application, each corresponding to an obvious portion of the application.
For the projects tab, when you hover over the images in this section you are presented with a button that takes you to the github repository.
